ðŸ”‘ Why key is needed:
When rendering a list (like with .map()), React needs a way to track each element so it can efficiently update the DOM when the list changes. The key helps React do this by giving each element a unique identity.

Without key, or with an unstable key, React may:

Re-render more elements than necessary

Lose component state (e.g. input fields, checkboxes, etc.)

Perform inefficient DOM updates
